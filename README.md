# UofTHacks X - Re:New

Re:New is a mobile application aimed for university students to improve their mental health. It is an interactive mobile application that helps users take those difficult first steps towards accomplishing otherwise intimidating tasks. Whether it be used for breaking down significant goals into manageable steps or even just providing a convenient way to explore new interests, Re:New is an user-friendly app that makes it so much easier. Users are given randomized daily tasks in a topic of choice for a chance to develop healthy habits and learn something new at a controllable pace, expanding their mindsets and helping them stay healthy. Even more, you are provided an option to show your support for other users by “verifying” their completion of a task.
